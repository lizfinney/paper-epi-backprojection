# Contents

1. Branching process simulations: The directory `src/simulations/` contains script to generate and analyze simulations. Generating simulations is done in the notebook `simulation-running.ipynb`, and `simulation-visualization.ipynb` contains analysis and paper figures.

2. Back-projection implementation: The directory `src/data-processing-pipeline/deconvolution` contains our implementation of back-projection for SARS-CoV-2, originally described by Becker et al. 1991. The notebook `back-projection-example.ipynb` can be run with example inputs found in this directory. This directory contains production scripts which we run with an incubation period distribution and binomial weights found in `/deconvolution/distribution-files`. This folder also contains a file describing the back-projected output of a single collection time, which aids in computation time.

3. Data processing: The notebook `SC2-back-projection-pipeline.ipynb` is used for processing and analyzing the SARS-CoV-2 sequence data. Back-projection is applied to pre-processed sequences, and back-projected sequences are further processed (i.e. time series trimming) before inferring mutational effects. Scripts used for both the back-projected method and comparison method (see [Lee et al. 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55593-0)) are found in `src/data-processing-pipeline/scripts`. The notebook also contains code that produces necessary job files to run much of the data analysis with cluster computing. The original sequence data and metadata used here were obtained from [GISAID](https://gisaid.org/)

4. Figures: A notebook for visualizing allele trajectories and their inferred coefficients is done by `SC2-back-projection-visualization.ipynb`. This notebook allows for comparison between back-projected results and comparison results obtained with a naive moving-average smoothing. An additional notebook for generating figures found in the paper and supplementary material is done by `SC2-back-projection-paper-figures.ipynb`. Processed trajectories and selection coefficients can be found in `data/analysis-visualization`.
